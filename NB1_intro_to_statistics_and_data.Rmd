This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.


To see an example of the mean function

```{r}
example(mean)
```
Vectors can be assigned to an “object”. For example,
```{r}
X <- c(2,12,22,32,42)  # c() is a vector of doubles
typeof(X)
```

Sequences of numbers can be created using the seq and rep commands. For
example,
```{r}
seq(1,10)  # Both first and last items inclusive.
rep(1,10)  # Repeats first item second item times
```
Basic data structures are vectors, matrices, arrays, lists, and data frames. 
They can contain numeric values, logical values or even characters (strings). 
In the latter case, arithmetic operations are not allowed.

A numeric vector of length 5 can be constructed by the command
```{r}
X <- vector(mode='numeric', length = 5)
X
```
Logical vectors containing the values TRUE and FALSE are also possible.
Also note that R language supports 1 based indexing, not 0 like Python.
```{r}
X <- vector(mode='logical', length = 4)  # FALSE=0, TRUE=1
X
```
```{r}
X[1] = X[2] = X[4] = TRUE
mean(X)
```
A matrix can be constructed by the matrix() command:
```{r}
X <- matrix(nrow=4, ncol=2, data=seq(1,8), byrow = T)
X
```
The above can also be written as:
```{r}
X <- matrix(4, 2, data=1:8, byrow = TRUE)  # Note that default is byrow = False
X 
```
Arrays are more general data structures than vectors and matrices in the sense
that they can have more than two dimensions. For instance,
```{r}
X <- array(data = 1:12, dim = c(3,2,2))
X
#  creates a three-dimensional array with 3 · 2 · 2 = 12 elements.
```
A list can contain objects of different types. For example, a list element can 
be a vector or matrix. Lists can be initialized by the command list and can grow
dynamically. It is important to understand that list elements should be accessed
by the name of the entry via the dollar sign or using double brackets:

```{r}
X <- list(one=c(1,2,3,4,5), cars=c('mazda','bentley','ferrari','kia'))
X
```
```{r}
X[1]
X$one
```
Let's index cars
```{r}
X$cars
```
let's select only Ferrari.
```{r}
X$cars[3]
```
some more
```{r}
X[[2]]
```
